# osu-web-player

> A web osu! beatmap player with multiplayer. Made for Hackathon of Replit.

## Development

I use Replit to deploy the app with the backend.
**Yarn** is recommended instead of NPM.

```bash
# Install dependencies.
yarn

# Start development server.
yarn dev

# Build the app with API.
yarn build

# Start the builded app.
yarn serve
